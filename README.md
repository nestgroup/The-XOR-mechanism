MATLAB implementation of the XOR mechanism which protects the differential privacy of binary- and matrix-valued data query. The mechanism was introduced in the VLDB 2021 paper “Differentially Private Binary- and Matrix-Valued Data Query: An XOR Mechanism”.

The script toy_example.m runs the MATLAB implementation and reproduces similar experiment results of the toy example in the paper.

Similarly, the other scripts reproduce similar experiment results for the study cases considering different datasets investigated in the paper by using the proposed XOR mechanism.
